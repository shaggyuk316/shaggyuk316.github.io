                <h4>Binary Cube Spinning</h4>
                <p>A Binary Cube spins steadily as a solid shape, representing a stable structure in Grokox Theory’s Chaotic System Phases (Theory 1). Use the Mixer to adjust its settings and explore its behavior with gases, particles, or other shapes, including color mixing effects.</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Learn about the stability of structures in chaotic systems and how they interact with other states of matter.</p>
