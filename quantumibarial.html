            <h2>Theory 1 Overview</h2>
            <p>Grokox Theory’s Chaotic System Phases (Theory 1) explore the interaction of stable structures (Binary - Solid), dynamic energy (QuantSpark - Gas), and chaotic breakdown (ChaosBloom - Particles), influenced by external forces like sound. Use the Mixer to adjust settings and observe color mixing when elements interact.</p>
            <h3>Binary Phase (Cube - Solid)</h3>
            <p>Stable structures reacting to sound as a solid shape.</p>
            <h4>Animation Description</h4>
            <p>A Binary Cube scales and rotates with sound input, representing a stable structure as a solid shape. Adjust its settings in the Mixer.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Learn how stable systems in Grokox Theory adapt to chaotic influences.</p>
            <h3>QuantSpark Phase (Flare - Gas)</h3>
            <p>Dynamic energy flares reacting to sound as a gas.</p>
            <h4>Animation Description</h4>
            <p>A QuantSpark Flare, visualized as a gas cloud, scales and moves with sound, representing dynamic energy. Adjust its settings in the Mixer.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Understand how energy flares respond to chaotic influences.</p>
            <h3>ChaosBloom Phase (Points - Particles)</h3>
            <p>Chaotic particle systems reacting to sound as particles.</p>
            <h4>Animation Description</h4>
            <p>ChaosBloom Points scatter chaotically, representing the breakdown of systems into smaller chaotic particles. Adjust their settings in the Mixer.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Discover how chaotic particle systems behave under external forces.</p>
