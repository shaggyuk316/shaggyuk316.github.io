            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Grokox Theory Project! This site explores chaotic systems through two theories: Chaotic System Phases (Theory 1) with Binary, QuantSpark, ChaosBloom, and Orbits animations (including particles, gases, solids), and Quantum Calculations (Theory 2) with a computational tool. View animations of shapes, particles, gases, solids, and orbits, and adjust all settings in the Mixer. Also, explore GKCERN for a CERN-inspired simulation with 8 particle types. Have fun learning about chaos, quantum dynamics, and particle physics!</p>
            <h2>Showcase Animations</h2>
            <p>Below is a preview of the animations you can interact with on other pages. These presets demonstrate each element’s behavior without operational controls.</p>
            <h4>Binary Cube Spinning (Theory 1)</h4>
            <p>A Binary Cube spins steadily, representing a stable structure as a solid shape. On the Binary Cube page, you can view its animation and adjust settings in the Mixer.</p>
