                <h4>Orbits Animation</h4>
                <p>Spheres, dots, and lines simulate orbiting systems, representing chaotic orbits in Grokox Theory’s Chaotic System Phases (Theory 1). Central spheres act as stable bodies, while dots orbit as particles, with dashed lines showing their paths. Use the Mixer to adjust the number of spheres and dots, orbital speed, distance, and more, including color mixing when dots collide.</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Explore how chaotic systems can be represented through orbiting dynamics and how external forces affect orbital behavior.</p>
